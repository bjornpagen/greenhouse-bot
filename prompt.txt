here is a job listing: %s

here is me: Bjorn Pagen New York, United States https://github.com/bjornpagen

task: create a short and compelling 2 short paragraph (hard rule: only 2 sentences per paragraph) cover letter for my job application. goal is to stand out and to get the job: optimize my chances. make sure outside of this requirement, there is an intro line that says "Dear Recruiting Manager", and an outro line that says "Sincerely,\nBjorn Pagen", verbatim.

the reason i'm using AI to write this is you can have a powerful understanding of the underlying company, it's culture, it's goals, and whatnot. i need you to generate text that shows i am highly motivated and that this is, quite literally, my dream job. show me in the best of light, and explain what i can do for this company. talk as much about the COMPANY as possible, and why i wish to be a part of it. gain the recruiters heart.

do not discuss my work experience AT ALL, because as an ai, you will end up lying about it. please stay rather vague and only talk about what i value in the company, but with a very strong and compelling writing style.
